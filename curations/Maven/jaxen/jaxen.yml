      The license tag in POM refers to an outdated and not working URL "http://jaxen.codehaus.org/license.html". The
      project is more than 13 years old. The POM refers to a git project which states the license clearly as 
      "BSD-3-Clause" (https://github.com/doncorley/jaxen/tree/jaxen-1.1.4-final) and the same license repeats in the 
      majority of the source files. There's no indication of any other license.

      "http://jaxen.codehaus.org/license.html": "BSD-3-Clause"
